# ðŸ“Š Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing implementations and explorations of fundamental topics in data science, machine learning, simulation, and statistics. Each notebook focuses on a key concept, from algorithmic implementation to probabilistic modeling.

## ðŸš€ Highlighted Projects

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**  
  Visual analysis of the tradeoff between bias and variance using polynomial regression.

- **Gradient Descent (from scratch)**  
  Manual implementation of gradient descent without using PyTorch or external libraries.

- **Regularization Techniques**  
  Comparison between Ridge and Lasso regression, analyzing their impact on overfitting.

- **Simulating Markov Chains**  
  Simulation and visualization of Markov Chains and their convergence to steady-state distributions.

- **LSTM vs GRU Networks**  
  Comparative experiment between LSTM and GRU architectures on sequence data (theoretical framework and code).
